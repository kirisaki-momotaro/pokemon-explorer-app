## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (latest stable version) â†’ [Download Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Android Studio** (or an emulator setup) â†’ [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- **Android SDK** (installed with Android Studio)
- **A physical Android device** (USB debugging enabled) or an emulator
- **Git** (to clone the repository) â†’ [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/pokemon-explorer-app.git
cd pokemon-explorer-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed:
```sh
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Connect an Android Device or Start an Emulator
#### Option 1: Use a Physical Device
1. Enable **Developer Mode** and **USB Debugging** on your Android device.
2. Connect your device via USB.
3. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter devices
   ```
   You should see your device listed.

#### Option 2: Use an Emulator
1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Go to **AVD Manager** and start an emulator.
3. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter devices
   ```
   The emulator should be listed.

### 4. Run the App
To launch the app on your connected device or emulator, run:
```sh
flutter run
```
This will build and deploy the app.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Connected Devices Found
- Ensure your device is connected via USB and **USB Debugging** is enabled.
- Restart **adb**:
  ```sh
  adb kill-server
  adb start-server
  ```

### Issue: Gradle Build Fails
- Run:
  ```sh
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  ```
- Ensure you have **Java 17+** installed and configured.

### Issue: Emulator Runs Slow
- Allocate more **RAM** and **CPU cores** in AVD Manager.
- Try using a **physical device** instead.

## Additional Commands

### Check Available Devices
```sh
flutter devices
```

### Run in Release Mode (for better performance)
```sh
flutter run --release
```

### Build APK for Distribution
```sh
flutter build apk
```
